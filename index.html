<h2>Why I chose GitHub to host my site</h2>
<p> I chose GitHub for many reasons, the first being that the site is free, nevertheless you can still choose to pay for a premium package starting at £3.67 a month.</p>
<p>The free acount is given a few perks still...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cost-effective: GitHub Pages is free to use, making it an excellent option for people who want to create websites with small budgets.</li>
    <li>You can easily track changes.</li>
    <li>collaborate with other users.</li>
    <li>GitHub automatically updates your website, making sure the latest version is always available.</li>
    <li>GitHub Pages is backed by GitHub's robust infrastructure, providing reliable and secure hosting for your website.</li>
    <li> GitHub Pages automatically has a bug/feature reporting system called Issues that’s available to every publication you create.</li>
    <li>Because of the GitHub integration it’s ideal for teams</li>
  </ul>  
  
<p>With easy collaboration tools, GitHub makes it simple for multiple people to work together on a website. It's very simple to share code,
    track changes and collaborate with others using Git, a version control system.
    Github Pages is a feature that allows you to publish your website directly from a GitHub repository. It's simple to set up and provides a reliable host.
    another disarable benefit is the community here on GitHub, GitHub has a large community of developers and programmers, making it easy to connect with other developers, showcase your work and 
    contribute to open-source projects.
    GitHub offeres a user-friendly experience for hosting your own website and leverages the power of version control. Because of all these benefits, GitHub is a popular choice
    among developers.
